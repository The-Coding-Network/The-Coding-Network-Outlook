# TCN -> Future Outlook
Hello everyone, It's me, Max(Discord: MT#0006).
I'm one of the founders of TCN as you may know, and it has come to my attention
that it is time for us to update you all on what you can expect from us in the future.
Firstly, i would like to point out that we have major plans for the rest
of 2021 and the whole of 2022. Please read below for more information.
# Notices
-> i am in my final year at school, so i will not be as active as i usually am.
-> Development will slow during this period. but when summer rolls around things will
   get back to normal hopefully
# Concorde Bot
As you can see, Concorde Bot is now in a state where it is almost ready for a public
version to be released. We just have to figure out hosting it and some other technical
problems first. The bot will be in two versions of itself. Public, which can be added
to any servers and private, which can only be added to servers that meet the minimum 
requirements, as stated in the info channed in Concorde's server.
# Server Projects
Some of you may not know but we have worked on 4 major servers and are running them as
of now. Obviously we do not offer this as a service publicly, but rather as a passtime
when we are not doing much else. If we can manage to add members to the team, then maybe
this would become a service we will offer to users.The servers we have worked on are as
follows.
The Coding Network - Our server. The Headquaters of TCN. The home of all things we do.
Concorde - Our bot's server where all of its testing is done.
World Scouts Organization - a server that is in the works for the World Scouts Organization.
Galaxy's World - A server for a friend. Theres not much else to this one.
# -> Game Development
We have a plan in the works to develop a game of some kind in summer 2022. We do not
yet know how many people we will need to hire for the game to be made, but we are focusing
on making a game similar to Just Cause 3. closer to the time we will update the information
regarding the game.
# TCN - Visual Department Opens
January 2023. I can confirm that TCN will be starting a new division, regarding creating videos
and uploading them to the platform Youtube. As of now this is very in the works, but we are
hoping to pull it off when the time comes.
# A Final Note
I will update this file weekly adding more and more information as we go. As always, we will
do our best to keep things going, and we will update this file weekly as things move forward.
